# Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

### Introduction:
Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. In the context of data science, each column in an excel sheet or a relational database table is considered to be a dimension. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of columns/dimensions in the data such that there is an increase in the interpretability of the data while preserving maximum information. The reduced columns/dimensions obtained from the PCA algorithm are uncorrelated to each other. 

### Pre-requisites to understand the PCA algorithm:






### WIP - Rough:

There are two methodologies for implementing the PCA algorithm:
1. By solving the eigen vector
2. By computing the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)
